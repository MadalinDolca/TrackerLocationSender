# üñ≤Ô∏è TrackerLocationSender
This app obtains the current location of the device and sends it to a MQTT broker through a WorkManager every 15 minutes.

MQTT is a lightweight protocol for exchanging messages between devices in a publish-subscribe fashion.

This protocol has 3 main components:
1. **Client**: can be any device, in this case the app, that can communicate through this protocol.
   If it sends messages it acts as a **publisher**, if it receives messages it acts as a **receiver**.
2. **Broker**: is the system backend that filters and coordinates the messages to the clients.
3. **Topic**: is a keyword used by the Broker to filter the messages.

## Way of operation
After connecting to the Broker, a Client can publish messages to a specific topic, in this case `tracker/location`.
If the same or another client wants to receive messages, it has to **subscribe** to a certain topic like the above one.
When a client is publishing messages to a topic, the Broker will send that message to every subscriber of that topic.
Clients can publish/subscribe to multiple topics.

## How to send the messages
Launch the app, make sure that you have network connectivity and allow it to use the device's location.
The app will continuously get and send the location to the Broker even if it's in the background.

## How to receive messages
In order to see the published messages (coordinates) by the app, open this [Web Client](https://www.hivemq.com/demos/websocket-client/) and follow the steps.

### 1. Connect to the broker
In the **Connection** fill in the following fields like in the below picture:
- Host: `868b4e59e6c341379e82120b3e1d456e.s2.eu.hivemq.cloud`
